Objective:
The UK government wants to boast its efforts  to increase vaccination rates through marketing campaigns to promote the COVID vaccinations. This analysis uses Python to analyse and identify trends and patterns from the data sets provided in order to help informing the UK government the best possible province for their next COVID-19 vaccinations campaign.
This GitHub repository is setup to host the code, data files, Jupyter Notebooks and relevant documents for the data analysis to inform the UK about the COVID-19 vaccinations between January 2020 and October 2021. This GitHub repository forms part of the analysis workflow, allowing continuous analysis with additional data sets from different sources, contributions from other data analysts or researchers. 

Python version 3.10 is used for the analysis with the PEP 8 style and guidelines.
